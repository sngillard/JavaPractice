/* Edge Cases- score over 90 is an A (over 100 with extra credit), score below 70 is not passing

Interior Test
Test values that are within a specific range where the precise values that we entered within that range did not matter.

Edge Case
Values that are at the end of a testing range.

Corner Case
The value you are testing is in between two edge cases. */
